1. I did some Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Data (drivers and pings).
2. The timestamp needed to be converted to date, and as the date variable won't be useful for test dataset because it will have new dates, so I tried to derive few variables out of the date variable.
3. Variables were day of week, month, date number.
4. We receive pings after every 15 second, so I assumed every driver which pinged is online for the next 15 seconds. So I assumed each ping was 15 second long.
5. I then grouped by the driver id and date variable to get the count of pings and then multiplied by 15 /3600 to get the online hours.
6. We got 3 drivers which had duplicate profiles, we assumed their last row would be the correct one, so we used the last row of them.
7. We joined ping counts data with the driver data and also joined test data with the driver data to create a final train and test data respectively.
8. Converted all the categorical variable to numeric by creating columns of the categories and adding 0 if the row doesnt belong to that category otherwise 1.
9. We observed that there are no/less correlation among the feature variables
10. Now trained few regression models and using cross validation we selected Linear regression, support vector regression and gradient boosting (LR gave the best results on Cross validation)
11. Tried all the 3 models on the test data and also tried ensembles , Finalized linear regression as it gave the best results on root mean square error.

CV score for negative mean squared error were:

Linear Regression : mean: -5.138062 , sd: 0.131067
LASSO Regression: mean: -6.463259 , sd: 0.187020
Elastic Net Regression: mean: -6.030071 , sd: 0.166924
KNN Regression: mean: -6.061834 , sd: 0.205751
CART Regression: mean: -10.353689 , sd: 0.704090
GBM Regression: mean: -5.209813 , sd: 0.354412
Random Forest Regression: mean: -7.257589 , sd: 0.480903
Support vector regression: mean: -5.162834 , sd: 0.202581


So, we used Linear regression, GBM and Support vector regression to test on the test data.


Final Mean squared errors:

Linear Regression : 12.175311037762143
GBM : 17.50171338563262
SVR : 12.784650223364121
LR+GBM : 12.738536872393366
LR+SVR : 12.178777340163041
SVR+GBM : 13.671403968764658
LR+SVR+GBM : 12.432577564280596

These scores also suggested that linear regression is the best model for this data. We finalised linear regression.
