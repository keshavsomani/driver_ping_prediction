1. I did some Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Data (drivers and pings).
2. The timestamp needed to be converted to date, and as the date variable won't be useful for test dataset because it will have new dates, so I tried to derive few variables out of the date variable.
3. Variables were day of week, month, date number.
4. We receive pings after every 15 second, so I assumed every driver which pinged is online for the next 15 seconds. So I assumed each ping was 15 second long.
5. I then grouped by the driver id and date variable to get the count of pings and then multiplied by 15 /3600 to get the online hours.
6. We got 3 drivers which had duplicate profiles, we assumed their last row would be the correct one, so we used the last row of them.
7. We joined ping counts data with the driver data and also joined test data with the driver data to create a final train and test data respectively.
8. Converted all the categorical variable to numeric by creating columns of the categories and adding 0 if the row doesnt belong to that category otherwise 1.
9. We observed that there are no/less correlation among the feature variables
10. Now trained few regression models and using cross validation we selected Linear regression, support vector regression and gradient boosting (LR gave the best results on Cross validation)
11. Tried all the 3 models on the test data and also tried ensembles , Finalized linear regression as it gave the best results on root mean square error.
